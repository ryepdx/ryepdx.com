<h1>SovereignCyb.org</h1>

<p>A lot of the technology that empowers people does so while simultaneously
creating a large power disparity between the user of the technology and the
provider of the technology. In aggregate, this can result in an unhealthy
power dynamic between the technology provider and society as a whole.
<a href="http://sovereigncyb.org/">SovereignCyb.org</a> is a news feed focusing on
technology that empowers people while minimizing those sorts of power
disparities.</p>

<p>This is a new project of mine, but I&rsquo;ve long felt a need for it. It&rsquo;s hard to
be a thoughtful, engaged consumer in every sphere of consumption, but
particularly so in technology. There&rsquo;s very little ink spilled in popular
media over anything but the most superficial of technology&rsquo;s political and
social implications. It is much easier to find information about ethical food
sources, for example, than it is to find information about ethical
technological consumption. My hope is that SovereignCyb.org will help people
discover ideas and projects on the progressive edge of ethics and technology.</p>
