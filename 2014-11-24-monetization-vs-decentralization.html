<h1>Monetization v.s. Decentralization</h1>

<p><em>Written in response to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2nab2a/western_union_filed_a_copyright_claim_against_me/cmbu87h">/u/robboywonder&rsquo;s comment on

expressing a wish for peer-to-peer social media. Reproduced here because it
very nicely expresses my feelings on this subject at the moment. Please
express your agreement or disagreement in the comments! I&rsquo;d love to have a
real debate over these notions bouncing around in my head.</em></p>

<p>There have been a lot of attempts at federated social media solutions. I think
that approach is played out. As soon as I finish the paid work I&rsquo;m currently
doing, maybe even before then, I plan on beginning work on a true peer-to-peer
social network. I&rsquo;ve been reading and researching the subject for a few months
now and feel I&rsquo;ve just about got a good enough grip on things to take a decent
swing at it.</p>

<p>The technology, as it turns out, isn&rsquo;t all that complicated. Monetizing these
endeavors is really the hard part. Most money-seeking endeavors rely on
creating chokepoints, or points of centralization. A service that respects you
as a consumer and that protects your privacy by making it impossible for the
service&rsquo;s stewards to do otherwise cannot engage in these tactics. Thus they
rely on people consentually, voluntarily giving up some of their resources and
currency to help the project.</p>

<p>Even blockchain-based projects rely on creating a chokepoint to monetize
themselves. Access to the blockchain requires purchasing a token, which these
days often comes directly from the developers via an &ldquo;IPO.&rdquo; The blockchain
itself is decentralized, which puts it a step ahead of other money-seeking
endeavors, but it still technically constitutes a point of centralization that
can cause problems for people&rsquo;s privacy if too much is entrusted to it. You
can&rsquo;t really have forward-secrecy, for example, if all the messages ever
distributed in a system are recorded for all eternity in a blockchain. Or even
if all the messages get distributed to all the nodes in the network, since an
attacker can then keep a private record of those messages.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible to achieve a degree of privacy on the blockchain, but
for purposes of keeping messages secure, I have come to believe that the model
is wholly insufficient in itself. For it to really work, it has to pair with
some form of non-global messaging. Some form of side-channeling.</p>

<p>So monetization as it is traditionally done on the Internet and
decentralization seem to be fundamentally set against each other. You can&rsquo;t
have one and the other. If I start a peer-to-peer project and it gains
traction, the only chance it&rsquo;ll have of continuing into the future is if I can
monetize it via side channels. If I can make enough through donations,
speaker&rsquo;s fees, and selling swag, then I will be able to stay on it
indefinitely. If not, I&rsquo;ll eventually be forced to give up the reins to other
volunteers (if I&rsquo;ve managed to attract any by then) while I re-enter the
workforce to replenish my reserves.</p>

<p>These are, of course, only my opinions as of this moment. I admit I haven&rsquo;t
dug yet into Bitmessage as much as I&rsquo;d like to have, so I reserve the right to
be proven wrong and to change my opinion on blockchains in particular. It
feels weird that I feel like I need to say this, but the Internet is very good
at preserving opinions forever and then resurrecting those opinions at the
least possibly opportune times. Opinions change, and I would be quite happy to
be proven wrong on anything I&rsquo;ve written here.</p>
