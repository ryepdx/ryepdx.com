<h1>AngularJS at Devsigner 2014</h1>

<p>For those of you near Portland interested in seeing me speak in person, I&rsquo;ll
be giving my &ldquo;HTML Reloaded&rdquo; presentation at
<a href="http://devsignercon.com">Devsigner</a> this weekend.  Devsigner conference is
for &ldquo;the coders who paint and the designers who send pull requests.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a
rather timely endeavor, in my opinion, as I&rsquo;ve recently noticed increasing
crossover between the graphic design and developer worlds. The advent of CSS
compilers like Sass and Less, and of frontend frameworks like AngularJS, seem
to be both a result and a cause of this. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what
other people have to say about this emerging cross-disciplinary field.</p>
