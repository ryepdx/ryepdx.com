<h1>Magic Parser vs. SimpleXML</h1>

<p>Recently a client hired me to create a PHP script to populate a MySQL database
based on data in a series of XML files. A simple enough task, but the client
had recently spent $80 on a product called Magic Parser and so wanted me to
use the tool in my code. While I am sure the expenditure would have been worth
it had the task been different, I was not at all impressed with Magic Parser&rsquo;s
performance with this particular task.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m parsing through XML code I really want a tree-like structure. Magic
Parser returns everything in a flat array, with tag names separated by
slashes. For example:
<code>
&lt;foo&gt;
    &lt;bar&gt;A&lt;/bar&gt;
&lt;foo&gt;
</code></p>

<p>would return
<code>
Array([FOO]=&gt;"", [FOO/BAR]=&gt;"A")
</code></p>

<p>This causes problems if there is more than one tag with the same name. For
example:
<code>
&lt;foo&gt;
    &lt;bar&gt;A&lt;/bar&gt;
    &lt;bar&gt;B&lt;/bar&gt;
&lt;foo&gt;
</code></p>

<p>They work around this by sending three arrays to the callback function:
<code>
Array([BAR]=&gt;"A")
Array([BAR]=&gt;"B")
Array([FOO]=&gt;"", [FOO/BAR]=&gt;"A")
</code></p>

<p>This actually makes it harder to process the XML than if I were using
SimpleXML, as SimpleXML would return:
<code>
SimpleXML Object([bar]=&gt;Array([0]=&gt;"A", [1]=&gt;"B"))
</code></p>

<p>In SimpleXML I would just have to cycle through the array attached to the
&ldquo;bar&rdquo; property of the SimpleXML object. With MagicParser I have to figure out
if it&rsquo;s sending me a &ldquo;BAR&rdquo; array or a &ldquo;FOO/BAR&rdquo; array.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that if you just want to parse XML data, give Magic
Parser a wide berth and stick with something like SimpleXML. It does the job
better, it&rsquo;s free, and it&rsquo;s part of PHP&rsquo;s default installation.</p>
