<h1>Lifestreaming</h1>

<p>Boy, has it been a busy last couple months! I got a job at a startup so that&rsquo;s
consuming my life. The rock tour never took off, though I did end up going to
Canada. Now I have a few seconds before I run off to participate in my
writer&rsquo;s group.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting up the first bits of the Lifestream project. To keep from
annoying people too much, I&rsquo;m relegating it all to certain channels. The first
channel is up:</p>

<p>Check it out.</p>

<p>Ciao!</p>
