<h1>Life streaming and ryepdx.com</h1>

<p>I was reading a few tech articles today and watching some cool videos when I
realized I consume way more tech knowledge than I disseminate. I started
thinking about whether it would be possible to disseminate as I learn, whether
I could expedite that process. This converged with what I&rsquo;d been reading about
(data rot and the loss of historical artifacts to neglectful storage
techniques) and an idea that has been tugging at the corners of my mind since
I was in grade school: personal historical documentation, the idea that my
experiences and environment could be preserved indefinitely for the benefit of
future historians. On top of all this I encountered an article last night
about &ldquo;life streaming.&rdquo; It talked about Storytlr which, as far as I could tell
from the brief glance I gave it last night, amounted more or less to a feed
aggregator.</p>

<p>My long shift in the CS lab was today and I forgot to bring the charger for my
laptop. I started playing on the whiteboard instead and this is what I came up
with:</p>

<p><strong>Life streaming</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phase 1 - the immediately achievable</p>

<ul>
<li>Browser plugin for Chrome &amp; Firefox (my browsers of choice) which tweets and social bookmarks pages I like at the press of a button. Option to comment as I share. Tweets should be tagged with &ldquo;#visited&rdquo; or something. (I have a feeling this functionality might already be out there, but I&rsquo;ll have to check.) Also allow for the upload of <em>the set</em> (i.e, no duplicate URLs) of my browser&rsquo;s history at the end of the day, minus all my visits to Gmail and Facebook.</li>
<li>Use Shazaam and my laptop&rsquo;s microphone to automatically tweet what I&rsquo;m listening to. (Tagged with &ldquo;#listening_to&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Publicly accessible SVN repository (or at least a public folder) for non-proprietary code I&rsquo;m working on. Integration with Drupal (or Storytlr, if I make the switch), maybe with TRAC or SourceForge as a middleman for categorization and ease of use purposes.</li>
<li>SVN for written works, possibly with &ldquo;time travel&rdquo; slider in a Drupal/Storytlr module.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Phase 2 - the possible future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration with the soon-to-be-released Courier to allow you to flip through anything I write in that particular notebook.</li>
<li>Armband/glasses cam and mic with &ldquo;point of interest&rdquo; button to mark video data for expediting/automating the creation and upload of video blogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Phase 3 - the future fantastic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shazaam integration with armband/glasses for real-time and portable &ldquo;what I&rsquo;m listening to&rdquo; data.</li>
<li>Add GPS to armband/glasses to record location information. Could be used to automatically create 3D models of surroundings via <a href="http://www.photocitygame.com/">PhotoCity</a>-like software.</li>
<li>Book recognition via cover (front or back, image recognition or ISBN extraction) or example text extrapolated from image via OCR and identified via Google Books. Could allow automation/expediting of a &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m Reading&rdquo; function.</li>
<li>Speech recognition in armband/glasses for on-the-fly (if possible) creation of todo lists and appointments.</li>
<li>Movie recognition for &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m Watching&rdquo; feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Notes</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter to be used as an event alert service, using hash tags for categorization. (i.e, #read, #wrote, #coded, #updated, etc.)</li>
<li>Organizing all the data which will be produced may prove to be an enormous challenge, especially as life streaming gets smarter. A way to zoom in and out to various levels of detail may be useful, as would some kind of search engine capable of handling multimedia information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
