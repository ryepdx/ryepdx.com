<h1>Keeping PEAR HTTP_Client session data across pages</h1>

<p>I just spent three hours banging my head against this problem, so I hope I can
save you the trouble if you&rsquo;re where I was.</p>

<p>I was trying to save an HTTP_Client object in a PHP session so that it would
maintain its session data as it got moved from page to page. The idea was to
log into a website with it and then go to another page where it would be used
by various PHP scripts called by AJAX to perform tasks on the website I&rsquo;d
logged into. The only problem: I was getting logged out of the &lsquo;site every
time I left the script which logged me in. Somehow the HTTP_Client&rsquo;s session
data was being lost simply by my storing it in $_SESSION.</p>

<p>I made sure I was serializing and unserializing:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['client'] = serialize($client);  
...  
$client = unserialize($_SESSION['client']);  
</code></pre>

<p>Still nothing. I scoured the Internet for people who were having similar
problems. The only thing anybody could tell me was &ldquo;are you remembering to
serialize and unserialize?&rdquo; I scoured the pitifully scant documentation on
pear.php.net, trying to glean some shred of insight.</p>

<p>Still nothing.</p>

<p>So I decided to brute force the thing and trace the HTTP_Client&rsquo;s code by
hand. After mangling my beautiful PEAR classes with debug code, I noticed line
78 of CookieManager.php:</p>

<pre><code>function HTTP_Client_CookieManager($serializeSession = false)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, a minute,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.&rdquo; I changed that
sucker to:</p>

<pre><code>function HTTP_Client_CookieManager($serializeSession = true)
</code></pre>

<p>And it worked!</p>

<p>Now before you go hacking your PEAR modules, here&rsquo;s the <em>right</em> way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>$manager = new HTTP_Client_CookieManager(true);  
$client = new HTTP_Client(null, null, $manager);
</code></pre>
    </body>
