<h1>Getting the Compaq nx6125 Broadcom Wireless card to work in Ubuntu 11.10</h1>

<p>I remember trying to get Ubuntu to work on my Compaq nx6125 my freshman year
of college. The first and biggest hurdle was getting the wireless card to
work. Recently, after a few OS changes, I decided to go back to Ubuntu for
that machine. Imagine my dismay when I discovered the documentation on the
process hadn&rsquo;t changed much since my freshman year! Fortunately with a little
digging I was able to find a much simpler process. If you&rsquo;re trying to get
your Broadcom card to work in Ubuntu 11.10 (and possibly earlier versions, for
all I know), simply run:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer</code></p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Your wireless card should work.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you&rsquo;re not using Ubuntu and want to get your Broadcom 43xx wireless card to work in your particular flavor of Linux, you can find more documentation on the subject on <a href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43">this particular page of the Linux Wireless website</a>. That&rsquo;s where I discovered that handy little bit of command-line wizardry.</p>
