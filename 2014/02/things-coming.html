<h1>Things coming</h1>

<p>Since my last post, I&rsquo;ve decided that I really ought to do as much as possible
with other people&rsquo;s code. It seems to me that &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Repeat Other People&rdquo;
ought to be considered almost as important as &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact is that Wordpress has been a quite serviceable platform for me so
far, and I don&rsquo;t really want to expend a bunch of effort writing a whole new
blogging platform. I don&rsquo;t have much reason for doing so, to be honest, and I
will probably be of more use to more people if I build my new platform using
other people&rsquo;s components as much as possible</p>

<p>At present, I&rsquo;m of the mind to set up some sort of pub-sub server and to use
that to loosely join a bunch of different software platforms into a symbiotic
ecosystem of parts.</p>
