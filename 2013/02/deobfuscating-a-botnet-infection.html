<h1>De-obfuscating a botnet infection</h1>

<p>Last night I was working on a PHP website for a client when I stumbled upon
this line of code whitespaced way off the screen on the first line of a few of
our files:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016290" title="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016290">https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016290</a></p>

<p>That looked pretty suspicious to me, so I googled &ldquo;$GLOBALS[&lsquo;QQOO&rsquo;]&rdquo; and the
only result that came up was this Pastebin:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/71nwAsj6" title="http://pastebin.com/71nwAsj6">http://pastebin.com/71nwAsj6</a></p>

<p>Definitely didn&rsquo;t like the look of that, so I grepped the rest of our files
and found the same code embedded in the same way on four more files. I removed
it from all of them, re-uploaded the cleaned files, and got to work figuring
out what this code was doing.</p>

<p>I copied the code, commented out the call to &ldquo;$Ill11I1lI&rdquo; at the end of
&ldquo;function Q0QQOOQO,&rdquo; and echoed out $Ill11I1lI. This gave me &ldquo;preg_replace.&rdquo; A
little research revealed that the &ldquo;/e&rdquo; flag in preg_replace makes preg_replace
<em>automatically eval the result.</em> (This seems like a spectacularly bad design
decision to me, but that&rsquo;s just my opinion.)</p>

<p>So I echoed &ldquo;Q0QQOOQO(710, 2563)&rdquo; to see what code they were trying to make
preg_replace run. I got back:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016310" title="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016310">https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016310</a></p>

<p>More preg_replace eval'ing, so I commented out the call to &ldquo;$Q00Q0QOQQ&rdquo; and
echoed IlI11lll(721, 2563). I got back a pretty sizable string of code, which
I formatted and then took the liberty of renaming what was pretty obviously a
&ldquo;get string&rdquo; function to &ldquo;get_string.&rdquo; That gave me this code:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015935" title="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015935">https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015935</a></p>

<p>I then did a search for all calls to &ldquo;get_string&rdquo; and isolated them to one
line each, then used a little regex-fu to generate this PHP file:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015963" title="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015963">https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015963</a></p>

<p>And then I used the output from that PHP script to create a Python script (I
realize I could have just used PHP, but my Python-fu is stronger) to find and
replace all the calls to &ldquo;get_string&rdquo; with their actual returned values:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015978" title="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015978">https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5015978</a></p>

<p>That got me a file I could actually read somewhat. I started working my way
down the file, renaming variables like &ldquo;$QO0OQO&rdquo; and &ldquo;$IIl11I&rdquo; to things like
&ldquo;$curl&rdquo; and &ldquo;$curl_init.&rdquo; After working at it like a crossword puzzle (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
a name for the third parameter in fsockopen?&rdquo;) for around half an hour, I was
finally treated to its final, naked, legible form (which I then filled with
helpful comments):
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016252" title="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016252">https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016252</a></p>

<p>Basically this code allows the botnet owners to execute arbitrary PHP code on
the infected server. Not a very friendly piece of code!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Found obfuscated botnet code on a client&rsquo;s server and spent about an hour and a half making it readable: <a href="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016252" title="https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016252">https://gist.github.com/ryepdx/5016252</a></p>
